 - Created a CycleGAN using Keras
 - Dataset: apple2orange
 - It works. Results not impressive - network just changing color of item
 - Next step: will train same network on face dataset

 - Trained with a batch size of 32 (had used batch size 1 before)
 - Training speed up factor is very high
 - Performance of network is extremely disappointing
 - Problem of background inversion, very poor quality of generated images
